# Nautilus V2

A new version of an overworked prank.

# What is this?

It's a complete overhaul of an old project of mine, [NautilusUB](https://github.com/Tumbleweed-64/NautilusUB). It's a fake unblocker that instead of doing what you'd expect -- bypassing filters to play games -- really just opens a Google tab with a suspicious search query. You can use it to prank your friends, because that's what it was for. I started working on this update on April 1st, of course.

# What's new?

I've completely changed the graphics! The old one looked like it probably could have been made with HTML4 in 2002 or something, but the new version screams "modern" with some cool CSS animations that are probably not too good for the CPU. Anyway, try it out yourself today by hitting up the releases menu.

# Customizing

You can check the JS file to see the list of cursed queries so far, and you can add to them yourself, or even make them permanent with a pull request. You can also add some new splash texts (the sentences that appear under the search bar).
When testing new queries, remember to set the `devFlag` variable to true so they don't show up in **your** history.

# Other components
It does contain a legitimate tab cloaking functionality, with which you can select common school sites like Google Docs, Clever, TechSmart, and StudentVue.
